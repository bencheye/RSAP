<h3> Enrichment </h3> 
<p>
	Enrichment analysis is to infer the biological significance of differentially expressed genes among samples. Enrichment analysis can summarize the annotation information of these differentially expressed genes. Common enrichment analysis includes `GeneOntology (GO)` enrichment analysis and `KEGG` enrichment analysis. `ClusterProfiler` (v4.0.5), a R packages, is used for enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis results of `GO` and `KEGG` are shown in the figure below.
