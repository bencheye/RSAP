<h3> Alignment </h3>
<p>
	The function of sequence alignment is to map the short sequence reads into the reference genome or transcriptome. In RSAP, two common methods, `hisat2` (v2.1.0) and `STAR` (v2.7.9a), for RNASeq data alignment are provided. For `hisat2`, `samtools` (v1.7) is used to convert sam to bam.

	In this analysis, `{}` is used for alignment. Reference uses `{} `from `GENCODE`.
