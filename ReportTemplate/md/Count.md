### Count

`FeatureCounts` (v1.6.4) is used to count the number of mapping reads on genes (gene_id) in the alignment results to generate the genes expression matrix that the row corresponds to the gene id and the column corresponds to the sample name. Then, gene ID is converted into gene symbol according to GTF file and filtering the genes according to `{}`.

The gene expression matrix of the first ten rows is shown in the table below:
