Comparison between groups is to reduce the dimension of high-dimensional gene expression data to two-dimensional space through various methods, like `PCA` or `NMDS` provided in the RSAP. Then the heterogeneity between samples and groups is shown through the visualization of two-dimensional plane.

`PCA` and `NMDS` both can well show the global characteristics of data. The results of their two analyses are shown in the figure below. The horizontal axis and vertical axis represent the first dimension and the second dimension respectively. Each point in the figure represents a sample, and different colors represent different groups.
